I am a Ph.D. student in the [City and Regional Planning Department](https://planning.unc.edu/) at the University of North Carolina, working under the guidance of [Dr. Yan Song](https://planning.unc.edu/faculty/song/). 
I earned my bachelor's degree in Urban and Rural Planning from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) 
and my master's degree in City and Regional Planning from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). 

My research interest lies in the nexus of transportation and land use intergration.
